## What is a Raspberry Pi device?
A Raspberry Pi device is a small, powerful, and inexpensive single-baord computer (SBC). It enables wireless internet & bluetooth connectivity, HDMI/USB/Audio ports, and other devices found on a typical computer. It is commonly used to teach programming and building hardware projects to home automation, robotics, and can also act as a streamer or web server.

### Component List and their functions:

** CPU ** - ARM processor with integrated graphics. It is the heart of the device which controls the I/O devices and computations. 

** HDMI Ports ** - High Definition Multimedia Interface used for transmitting video and digital audtio data from a computer to monitor or digital TV. 

** GPIO Ports ** - General Purpose Input Output Ports which allows the user to interface various I/P devices. 

** Stereo Audio ** - Audio connector used for connecting audio output devices such as speakers and headphones.

** USB Ports ** - A common port available for various peripheral devices, such as a mouse, keyboard, HDD etc. This model has both 2.0 and 3.0 USB ports.  

** Micro SD Card Slot ** - SD card slot which is required for booting the device with an installed and functional operating system. 

** Ethernet Port ** - This connector allows the user access to a wirred network, however only available on the model B of Raspberry Pi.

** CSI Camera Port ** - Camera Serial Interface connects the Broadcom processor to the Pi camera. 

** 15-Pin Ribbon Connector ** - Display Serial Interface (DSI) is used for connecting LCD to Raspberry Pi using 15 15-pin ribbon cables. DSI provides a high-resolution display interface that is specifically used for sending video data.

** PoE HAT Header ** - The PoE HAT allows you to power your Raspberry Pi using Power over Ethernet–enabled networks. 

** USB-C Power Port ** - This USB-C port serves primarily as the power input, allowing the device to be powered via a USB-C power adapter.

### Component List and their functions:

** Ultrasonic Sensor **: This sensor measures the distance between itself and an object using ultrasonic waves. It's commonly used in obstacle detection for robots or distance measurement applications.

** 5050 RGB LED Stick **: A small stick of individually addressable RGB LEDs. It allows you to control the color and brightness of each LED independently, useful for creating colorful light effects.

** Lego Wheel **: A basic wheel part compatible with Lego Technic sets. Often used to create robot bases or moving vehicles.

** Wii Remote **: A game controller from the Nintendo Wii console, often repurposed in DIY projects to provide motion input or button controls via Bluetooth.

** 5MP Camera Module **: A small camera, likely compatible with Raspberry Pi, used to capture images or video, and can be implemented for computer vision projects.

** Infared Reflective Sensor **: This component measures temperature. It might output analog or digital signals to microcontrollers for applications like weather stations or environment monitoring.

** Vending Machine Breadboard **: A reusable board for prototyping electronic circuits without soldering. It allows you to connect various components and test circuit designs.

** Raspberry Pi Build HAT **: A small, affordable computer used for a variety of electronics projects. It serves as the control unit that can run programs, control sensors, and process data.

** Speaker **: A small audio output device used to produce sounds or play audio signals in projects.

** 2 x 20 Pin Connector **: A connector likely used to interface other components or GPIO pins with the Raspberry Pi, making it easier to connect various peripherals.

** Lego Color Sensor **: A sensor that detects the color of an object, often used in robotics for tasks like line following or object sorting.
